**Web development** is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. ^796e47
## Frontend:
The frontend is anything and everything visual that a user comes in contact with. It's all the parts with which they directly interact.
It's all the content and styles. It's the buttons and the different hover effects before a user clicks on a link. It's the contact forms with various input fields, the search boxes and the dropdown menus. The layouts, text, and colors. It's the images and videos.
However, it is not _just_ the styles. It is also how fast the website loads, how easy it is to navigate through it, and how accessible it is to people with disabilities. It's how usable and responsive it is on a variety of different devices and browsers.
Essentially, the frontend is all the parts of a web application that create the _look and feel_ of it.
## Backend:
Backend development deals with the technologies responsible for storing and securely manipulating user data.
It is the part associated with all the hidden logic that powers the applications users interact with.
Backend is considered the server-side part of an application. Backend is all the hidden inner workings and the behind-the-scenes processes in a web application. It refers to everything going on underneath the hood and all the necessary components that make the front-end function properly and smoothly. It makes sure everything is working optimally. Essentially, the backend is what the users don't have direct access to or don't directly interact with and are most likely unaware of when using an application.
## Server Client Communication:
**The client sends a request, and the server returns a response**. This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication. To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect.
